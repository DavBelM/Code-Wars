# CodeWars Solutions Repository

Welcome to my CodeWars Solutions Repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges (katas) completed on CodeWars. Each kata presents a unique problem-solving exercise, aimed at improving coding skills and algorithmic thinking.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Challenge Files**: Each solution is saved in its own file, with the filename based on the kata title or a brief description of the problem.
- **Difficulty Folders**: Solutions are organized by difficulty levels, ranging from "8 kyu" (beginner) to "1 kyu" (expert).
- **Documentation & Comments**: Each solution includes comments that explain the logic, approach, and possible alternative methods where applicable.
